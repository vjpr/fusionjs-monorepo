# fusion-plugin-rpc-redux-react

[![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/c16ece6ba0a81b30d11d69cb90b8f4d77a0967860144d12f44.svg?branch=master)](https://buildkite.com/uberopensource/fusion-plugin-rpc-redux-react)

Provides a higher order component that connects RPC methods to Redux as well as
React component props

RPC is a natural way of expressing that a server-side function should be run in response to a client-side function call. Unlike [RESTful architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer), RPC-based architectures are not required to conform to statelessness constraints and are free to return session-scoped data. Additionally, the semantics of RPC calls are not constrained by the availability of suitably-descriptive HTTP methods and RPC calls can express complex state change requests more naturally as verbs (e.g. `returnProduct(id)`) rather than object-orientation (e.g. `PATCH /api/orders/:id`).

#### `withRPCRedux`

```js
import {withRPCRedux} from 'fusion-plugin-rpc-redux-react';
```

Creates a higher order component with a prop mapped to the given RPC method. It
can additionally configure the mapped method with parameters from state or from
a transformation function.

```js
const hoc:HOC = withRPCRedux(rpcId: string, {
  propName: ?string,
  mapStateToParams: ?(state: any) => any,
  transformParams: ?(params: any) => any,
})

```

* `rpcId: string` - The name of the RPC method to expose in the component's
  props
* `propName: ?string` - Optional. The name of the prop. Defaults to the same as
  `rpcId`
* `mapStateToParams: ?(state: any) => any` - populate the RPC request with
  parameters from Redux state
* `transformParams: ?(params: any) => any` - transforms the params
* returns `hoc: Component => Component`

#### `withRPCReactor`

```js
import {withRPCReactor} from 'fusion-plugin-rpc-redux-react';
```

Creates a higher order component by colocating global reducers to the component

```js
const hoc:HOC = withRPCReactor(rpcId: string, {
  start: ?(state: any, action: Object) => any,
  success: ?(state: any, action: Object) => any,
  failure: ?(state: any, action: Object) => any,
}, {
  propName: ?string
  mapStateToParams: ?(state: any) => any,
  transformParams: ?(params: any) => any,
});
```

* `rpcId: string` - The name of the RPC method to expose in the component's
  props
* `start: ?(state: any, action: Object) => any` - A reducer to run when the RPC
  call is made
* `success: ?(state: any, action: Object) => any` - A reducer to run when the
  RPC call succeeds
* `failure: ?(state: any, action: Object) => any` - A reducer to run when the
  RPC call fails
* `propName: ?string` - Optional. The name of the prop. Defaults to the same as
  `rpcId`
* `mapStateToParams: ?(state: any) => any` - populate the RPC request with
  parameters from Redux state
* `transformParams: ?(params: any) => any` - transforms the params
* returns `hoc: Component => Component`

#### ResponseError

Use the `ResponseError` error subclass for sending error responses. If this
error class is not used, a generic message will be sent to the client.

```js
import {ResponseError} from 'fusion-plugin-rpc';

function testHandler() {
  try {
    doThing();
  } catch (e) {
    const error = new ResponseError('Failed to do thing');
    error.code = 'DOTHING';
    error.meta = {
      custom: 'metadata',
    };
    throw error;
  }
}
```

#### mock

```js
import {mock as MockRPC} from 'fusion-plugin-rpc-redux-react';
```

The package also exports a mock RPC plugin which can be useful for testing. For
example:

```js
app.register(RPCToken, mock);
```

### Other examples

### Usage with Reactors

[`redux-reactors`](https://github.com/ganemone/redux-reactors) is a library that
allows you to colocate Redux actions and reducers

The `fusion-plugin-rpc-redux-react` package provides a `withRPCReactor` HOC
which facilitates implementing a Redux store using reactors.

To use it, register the `fusion-plugin-react-redux` plugin with
`reactorEnhancer` from `redux-reactors`:

```js
// src/main.js
import App from 'fusion-react';
import Redux, {
  ReduxToken,
  ReducerToken,
  EnhancerToken
} from 'fusion-plugin-react-redux';
import RPC, {RPCToken, RPCHandlersToken} from 'fusion-plugin-rpc-redux-react';
import {FetchToken} from 'fusion-tokens';
import {reactorEnhancer} from 'redux-reactors';
import fetch from 'unfetch';

import reducer from './redux';
import handlers from './rpc';

export default () => {
  const app = new App();

  app.register(ReduxToken, Redux);
  app.register(ReducerToken, reducer);
  app.register(EnhancerToken, reactorEnhancer);

  app.register(RPCToken, RPC);
  app.register(RPCHandlersToken, handlers);
  app.register(FetchToken, fetch);
  return app;
}

// src/rpc.js
export default {
  increment() {
    return db.query(/* ... */).then(n => ({count: n}));
  }
}
```

Because `redux-reactors` is implemented as a Redux enhancer, it doesn't require
building reducers in the traditional Redux way. Thus, the root reducer can
simply be the identity function:

```js
// src/redux.js
export default state => state;
```

Here's how to implement a reactor:

```js
// src/reactors/increment.js
import {withRPCReactor} from 'fusion-plugin-rpc-redux-react';

export const incrementReactor = withRPCReactor('increment', {
  start: (state, action) => ({count: state.count, loading: true, error: ''});
  success: (state, action) => ({count: action.payload.count, loading: false, error: ''});
  failure: (state, action) => ({count: state.count, loading: false, error: action.payload.error});
});
```

`incrementReactor: Component => Component` is a React HOC. It defines three
actions: `start`, `success` and `failure`, which correspond to the respective
statuses of a HTTP request.

In the example above, when `increment` is called, the `start` action is
dispatched, which runs a reducer that sets `state.loading` to true,
`state.error` to false and keeps `state.count` intact. If the request completes
successfully, `state.loading` is set to false, and `state.count` is updated with
a new value. Similarly, if the request fails, `state.error` is set.

In addition to defining action/reducer pairs, the `incrementReactor` HOC also
maps RPC methods to React props.

Reactors typically need to be used in conjunction with `connect` from
`react-redux`, in order to map state to React.

Below is an example of consuming the state and RPC methods that are made
available from the Redux store and the RPC plugin.

```js
// src/components/example.js
import React from 'react';
import {connect} from 'react-redux';
import {compose} from 'redux';
import {incrementReactor} from './reactors/increment.js';

function Example({count, loading, error, increment}) {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <p>
        <button onClick={() => increment()}>Increment</button>
      </p>
      {loading && 'Loading...'}
      {error}
    </div>
  );
}

const hoc = compose(
  incrementReactor,
  connect(({count, loading, error}) => ({count, loading, error}))
);
export default hoc(Example);
```

### Differences between reactors and vanilla Redux

Redux colocates all valid actions in a respective "slot" in the state tree, and
colocates the structuring of the state tree via helpers such as
`combineReducers`. This means that a reducer can be unit tested by simply
calling the reducer with one of the valid actions, without having any effect on
any other state that might exist in the app. The downside is that if an action
needs to modify multiple "slots" in the state tree, it can be tedious to find
all transformations pertaining to any given action.

Another point worth mentioning is that with traditional reducers, it's possible
to refactor the state tree in such a way that doesn't make any changes to
reducers or components (albeit it does require changing the reducer composition
chain as well as all relevant `mapStateToProps` functions).

Reactors, on the other hand, colocate a single reducer to a single action, so
all state transformations pertaining to any given action are handled by a single
function. This comes at the cost of flexibility: it's no longer possible to
refactor the shape of the state tree without changing every affectd reducer, and
it's also possible to affect unrelated parts of the state tree, for example
missing properties due to an overly conservative object assignment.

However doing large refactors to the shape of the state tree isn't necessarily
all that common and it's often more intuitive to see all possible state
transformations for a given action in a single place. In addition to creating
less boilerplate, this pattern leads to similarly intuitive tests that are also
colocated by action.
